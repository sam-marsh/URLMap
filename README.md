# URLMap
A safari extension for redirecting addresses using regex matching and replacement.

Use regex to match addresses, and then you can access the matched groups in the replacement using `<<1>>`, `<<2>>` etc.

Warning: I have barely tested this and it probably still has a couple of bugs!

## Example
I use this for automatically redirecting imgur .gif addresses to the corresponding .gifv address:
